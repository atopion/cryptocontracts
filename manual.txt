Hello and welcome to CryptoContracts!
First of all, great decision to choose this system.

Here are the steps listed that you need to perform in order to start the program:

1) State the necessary information in the "config.ini" file:
	This file needs to contain information about IP Server address, port numbers and database directory.
	A template file can be found in the main directory

2) Make sure that open the port specified under the section server in the config.ini file is open.
	Usually you can open ports in the network settings of your router

3) Start the Peer function:
	execute the file /cryptocontracts/exec_peer.py
	This program creates a peer object and connects to the network
	For a list of all the possible commands enter help.

4) If you want to add a block to the chain you need to start the GUI:
	This requires that step 3) has been perfomed
	execute the file /cryptocontracts/exec_gui.py
	This program starts the GUI where you have to insert the contract, your key pair and the address of your contract partner
	After connecting with your partner you can send the document.
	In the end the block is added to your local chain and directly published to the network
